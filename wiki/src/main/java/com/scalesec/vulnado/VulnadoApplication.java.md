# VulnadoApplication Documentation

## Overview
The `VulnadoApplication` class serves as the entry point for a Spring Boot application. It is annotated with `@SpringBootApplication` and `@ServletComponentScan`, enabling Spring Boot's auto-configuration and scanning for servlet components. The application also includes a call to a custom `Postgres.setup()` method, which likely initializes database-related configurations.

## Class Details

### Class Name
`VulnadoApplication`

### Package
`com.scalesec.vulnado`

### Annotations
| Annotation              | Purpose                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `@SpringBootApplication` | Enables Spring Boot's auto-configuration, component scanning, and configuration support. |
| `@ServletComponentScan`  | Scans for servlet components such as filters and listeners within the application. |

## Methods

### `main(String[] args)`
The `main` method is the entry point of the application. It performs the following tasks:
1. **Database Setup**: Calls `Postgres.setup()` to initialize database-related configurations. This method is assumed to be part of the application but is not defined in the provided code snippet.
2. **Application Startup**: Invokes `SpringApplication.run()` to bootstrap the Spring Boot application.

#### Parameters
| Parameter | Type     | Description                          |
|-----------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| `args`    | `String[]` | Command-line arguments passed to the application. |

## Insights

- **Database Initialization**: The call to `Postgres.setup()` suggests that the application relies on a PostgreSQL database. Proper error handling and validation should be implemented in the `Postgres.setup()` method to ensure smooth database initialization.
- **Servlet Component Scanning**: The use of `@ServletComponentScan` indicates that the application may include custom servlets, filters, or listeners. These components should be carefully managed to avoid security vulnerabilities.
- **Spring Boot Features**: The `@SpringBootApplication` annotation simplifies the configuration process by combining `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan`. This makes the application highly extensible and modular.

## Dependencies
The application depends on the following Spring Boot modules:
- **Spring Boot Starter**: Provides the core functionality for building Spring Boot applications.
- **Spring Boot Web**: Likely included to support web-related features such as servlets and REST APIs.
